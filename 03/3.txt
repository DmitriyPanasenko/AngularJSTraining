Lesson 3: Custom Directives & Filters

	=[Custom directives]=

Directive in Angular is Factory (many instances in the app, not a singleton)

Techtalks in GL:  Gulp, Grunt, Bower

Directive restrict:
	E - element
	A - attribute
	C - class
	
!!! RULE: Do not use directives for business logic => Do not change scope and add business logic to scope in directive.

Events:
mouseenter = hover in
mouseleave = hover out

DRY - Do not repeat yourself => Directive Isolated Scope  

Isolate scope:
//& - method; =  - variable binding, @ - string


Memory leak in directives: Event inside directive was added to body (example). Then directive is removed from DOM, added event will not be deleted.

 Use scope.$on('$destroy', function(){
	//clean up custom events before directives is destroyed
 });
 
 Use directives as attributes because of browser compatibility.

Filters can be used in HTML and JS code
